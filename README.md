# Portfolio site for Paul Craig (reboot)

Paul Craig (me), web developer par excellent, needs the very best trophy case for my super awesome websites everyone likes and nobody doesn't.

The philosophy behind it is simple: my content is so good that the only thing that should get in the way of it is an arguably obnoxious web-design trend that calls attention to itself by a self-aware display of fake carelessness. But _I_ would say that it's about FOREFRONTING the CONTENT.

Other than that, it's just you (the viewer) and the site with a bunch of stuff I want you to look at, although you may not be so interested. In the latter case, no problem: it's a big internet and there's probably somewhere else you can go. In the former case (you _are_ interested in reading [about me](https://pcraig3.ca/about/) and [my work](https://pcraig3.ca/work/)), I am thrilled on your behalf. Make sure to resize your browser to check out the cool collapsing menu.
