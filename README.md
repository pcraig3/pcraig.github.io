# Portfolio site for Julia Craig (reboot)

Julia Craig, oil painter extraordinaire, needs the very best trophy case for her super awesome paintings. She is adamant that she needs this; in no way is this an un-asked-for experiment to learn about how [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) works.

The philosophy behind it is simple: her paintings are so good that the only thing that should get in the way of them is an obnoxious new web-design trend that calls attention to itself by a self-aware display of fake carelessness.

Other than that, it's just you (the viewer) and the paintings (which aren't on the site yet).  Make sure to resize your browser to check out the cool collapsing menu.
