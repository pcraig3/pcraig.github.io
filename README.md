# Portfolio site for Paul Craig (reboot)

Paul Craig (me), web developer par excellent, needs the very best trophy case for my super awesome websites everyone likes and nobody doesn't.

The philosophy behind it is simple: my content is so good that the only thing that should get in the way of them is an obnoxious new web-design trend that calls attention to itself by a self-aware display of fake carelessness.

Other than that, it's just you (the viewer) and the site which isn't really ready yet.  Make sure to resize your browser to check out the cool collapsing menu.
