      In January 2021, I designed, built, and shipped{' '}

      , an auto-updating progress tracker that gave you the headline figure and then got out of the
      way.

      During January’s provincial lockdown, vaccines were a hot news item but still scarce in
      Canada, meanwhile the government was predicting{' '}

      (effectively, half of Canadians halfway through the year).{' '}
      <a href="https://canada-vaccine-tracker.ca/methodology" target="_blank">
        The core idea here
      </a>{' '}
      was to compare the progress of vaccines vs. the progress of the year.

      The site is built in{' '}

      , and it was fun thinking through how to build them with accessibility in mind. It was also
      fun to get away from the{' '}

      for a few weeks (although arguably it’s a dialect).

      The good outcome here was building a working app and shipping it in under a week. Sometimes
      government technology groups want to spend 12 months deciding that 10-year old tech is too
      cutting-edge to use just yet, so it’s nice to just{' '}
