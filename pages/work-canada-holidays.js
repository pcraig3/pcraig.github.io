      Since September 2019, Iâ€™ve been the cleanest-designed authority on
      Canadaâ€™s stat holidays: helping working-class canucks sleep in, return
      stuff to the mall, drive to Peterborough, or whatever else you might do on
      a 3-day weekend.

      Inspired by{' '}

      Initially a Java + React containerized microservice-y thing (

        still up!

      ), I later decided to re-tool and release it for real. Microservices are a
      great solution to problems I didnâ€™t encounter, so I combined the API and
      UI together into{' '}

      is a small but instructive example of a soup-to-nuts modern web app. It
      was quick to build, fast to release, it auto-deploys on merge, itâ€™s hella
      accessible, itâ€™s iterated based on user feedback, and it doesnâ€™t solve
      problems it doesnâ€™t have. Currently itâ€™s{' '}
