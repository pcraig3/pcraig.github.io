      Between November 2018 and January 2020, I was Technical Lead on a{' '}
      <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/" target="_blank">
        Canadian Digital Service (CDS)
      </a>{' '}
      project to improve the way Canadians receive benefits. Beginning with an organizational
      discovery and ending with a whimper, the service trialled expedited filing for low-confidence
      tax-filers in Ontario.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lead technologist on the team, I was responsible for prototyping and delivering a
      resilient and accessible service to validate with Real Canadians‚Ñ¢, for setting up longer-term
      practices (CI/CD, tests [hint: the prototype is the product]), and for integrating with the
      legacy infrastructure at the{' '}
      <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html" target="_blank">
        Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
      </a>
      . It was a big role, though the day-to-day depended on{' '}

      During the <strong>Discovery</strong>, my focus was on the archeology of our partner
      department: who are we working with? how do they plan their work? what systems are implicated?
      What are the constraints? The reports I wrote elaborated the context and made the case to move
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <strong>Alpha</strong> phase, myself and the CRA Service Owner came up with the initial
      concept, which we then refined with our Service Designer. I built various initial prototypes
      using different technology stacks to find a balance between the preferences of our modern dev
      shop and CRA‚Äôs legacy environment.

      While working towards a live <strong>Beta</strong>, I led a small but capable team of
      inter-departmental developers as we built a snappy and accessible frontend. I regularly met
      with with CRA stakeholders about our progress and changes to our scope of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we never launched the service due to conflicting priorities between our two
      organizations. During the mothballing period, I (plus{' '}
